- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yvonney2019
- 👀 I’m interested in creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like React, Redux, TypeScript, and Next.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about AWS cloud services and serverless architecture, as I find the scalability and efficiency of this approach fascinating.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in web development. If you have an idea that can make a difference or improve user experiences in unique ways, count me in!
